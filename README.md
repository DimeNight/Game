**HTML Structure** : The HTML file provides the foundation for the game's structure, defining key elements such as the game container, game over message, character (dinosaur), and score display. This structure forms the visual layout of the game.

**Preloading Images** : Preloading images ensures that essential game graphics, such as the background, dinosaur, and dragon, are loaded in advance. This minimizes latency during gameplay, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience by reducing the time it takes to load these visual assets.

**External Fonts** : The project enhances the visual appeal of text elements within the game by incorporating the "Ubuntu" font from Google Fonts, giving the game a distinct and stylish typography.


**Audio Integration** : The inclusion of audio elements, such as background music and a game over sound, enriches the gaming experience by adding an auditory dimension. It provides players with audio cues and feedback, making the game more engaging.

**Dinosaur Animation** : Player input, specifically pressing the up arrow key, triggers an animation effect for the dinosaur character. This animation simulates a jump action, making the gameplay more dynamic and visually appealing.

**Dinosaur Movement** : The right and left arrow keys enable horizontal movement for the dinosaur character. Players can navigate the character within the game container, allowing for evasion of obstacles and interaction with the game environment.

**Obstacle Collision** : The game continuously monitors the positions of the dinosaur and the obstacle. If their positions overlap, it indicates a collision. In response, the game displays a "Game Over" message, stops the game's audio, and plays a game over sound effect, signaling the end of the game.

**Scoring System** : The game features a scoring system that rewards players for successfully crossing obstacles. When the dinosaur crosses an obstacle, the player's score increases, providing motivation to continue playing and achieve a higher score.
